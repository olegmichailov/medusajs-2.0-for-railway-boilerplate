        Every T-shirt and sweatshirt is individually hand-printed with
        original linocut graphics, turning fashion into a statement and each
        piece into an artwork.

        GMORKL is not just clothing — it’s a philosophy. We believe in art that
        moves, breathes, and walks the streets.
